GlessHub has experienced rapid growth as a digital innovation center in the
Alpine region. And to meet the increasing demand for networking, they reached
out to me again to design their new meeting room called GlessHub_Garden Space.
Our shared goal, alongside the marketing team, was to design an experience for
viewers that would transport them to a serene environment seamlessly integrated
with nature. We wanted to foster an atmosphere where work and creativity flow
effortlessly while also evoking an emotional connection with the imagery.
Thatâ€™s how these illustrations, inspired by classical gardens, came to life.
I incorporated a storytelling element featuring mythical creatures coexisting
with regular individuals under this atmosphere of digital innovation. These
illustrations now adorn their storefronts, website, and social media platforms,
establishing a unique connection with their audience and elevating the brand
with a premium style and identity.
