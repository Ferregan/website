<Description>
WIN is a card game illustrated on commission for Vaheh Khachatouri. And no, it’s not your typical game full of stock images or self-help clichés. Instead, I created an illustrated universe where common people are hit by a revelation at the office. The goal? Inspiration, but in a way that’s actually fun and engaging. Vaheh’s vision was to create something that would spark reflection and team collaboration, not just another corporate tool. My role was to make sure this game was a visual experience worth keeping, not something that just ends up in the drawer after a motivational workshop.
