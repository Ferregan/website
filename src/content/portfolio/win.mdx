<Description>
win is a card game illustrated on commission by Vaheh Khachatouri. Far from being another game filled with stock images and tired self-help clichés, it was conceived as an illustrated universe where ordinary characters are struck by a revelation. According to Vaheh, the goal was to create something that, in a fun and engaging way, would spark reflection and foster team collaboration—not just another corporate tool. My approach was to ensure that the game would not only be useful but also memorable.
