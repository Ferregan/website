<Description>
    GlessHub is more than a coworking spaceâ€”it's a meeting point for tech startups and digital companies. To build their reputation, they needed a visual identity that matched their creative vibe. As part of the marketing team, I helped design their corporate look, including illustrations for their website, posters, newsletters, and social media. The concept focused on simplicity and people, using bold visuals and fewer words to convey key ideas. This approach worked, making GlessHub a key player in the Alpine region and nearby countries like Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Italy. It's now a hub for connection, dialogue, and digital innovation.
