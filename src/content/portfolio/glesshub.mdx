GlessHub is not just a coworking space; it is a hub for innovation and idea
exchange among technology startups and digital companies.
In their journey to establish themselves as a renowned reference, they
recognized the importance of creating a visual identity that would effectively
communicate with those who wanted to be part of their creative atmosphere.
As part of the marketing team, my role was to assist in developing GlessHubâ€™s
corporate design, which included illustrations for their website, posters,
newsletters, and social media. The visual concept revolved around simplicity,
focusing on people as the core element. By using fewer words and vibrant images,
we aimed to convey significant values and ensure usability across all platforms.
The strategy proved successful, and GlessHub has now become a prominent presence
in the Alpine region of Austria and its neighboring countries, such as Germany,
Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Italy. It serves as a central hub for gathering,
fostering dialogue, and driving digital innovation.
