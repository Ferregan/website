<Description>
    WIN is an illustrated card game designed by Gustavo Ferregan,
    commissioned by business consultant Vaheh Khachatouri. This
    game aims to become an educational tool that allows teams to
    inspire each other through gameplay, exploring new concepts
    related to teamwork. The illustrations, which depict people
    in everyday situations within work environments, transform
    this illustrated universe into more than just a game; it is
    an immersive experience carefully crafted to ensure that work
    is not taken too seriously and is not viewed as just another
    activity in corporate life. In fact, the design of characters
    in absurd and humorous situations seeks to create connections
    with common experiences, fostering empathy and collaboration.
    Each move within the game turns into a disguised lesson,
    inviting participants to reflect on their work dynamics and
    strengthen team cohesion in a fun and enjoyable way.
