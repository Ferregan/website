Khachatouri advises companies, and develops strategies, all while leveraging a
wealth of knowledge, theories, and expertise. In this project, I had the
privilege of developing a brand illustration strategy with him – a strategy for
his external communication. It aimed to explain complex ideas simply and create
a memorable impression using humor and storytelling. To achieve this, we crafted
an illustration system. By applying simple rules and patterns, Khachatouri now
possesses a distinctive, recognizable, and unique style. This allows him to make
an impact in his presentations, blog, social media, printed materials, and
personal communication with clients, presenting a professional and modern look
that brings a smile to everyone’s face.
