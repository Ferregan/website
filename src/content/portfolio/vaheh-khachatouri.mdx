Consolidate is software designed to optimize internal tasks in companies. With
clients across Europe, its reach is constantly expanding. The Consolidate team
comprises programmers, UX/UI designers, business experts, and workplace
specialists. Together, they collaborate to create a simple and efficient work
environment for themselves and the companies they aim to assist.         When I
was invited to collaborate on the Consolidate Teams project as an illustrator
and designer, I worked closely with the programming and UX/UI teams to create
visual elements that would define the personality and style of the different
teams within Consolidate. For instance, one of these teams is known as “Zebras”
and focuses on marketing and public relations.          These illustrations play
a crucial role within the company, as they not only assign roles to each team
but also serve as a communication system for defining tasks and objectives in
relation to other groups. These illustrations are integrated into interfaces,
newsletters, avatars, and posters within the offices, enhancing the overall
visual experience and creating a unique visual identity for Consolidate.
