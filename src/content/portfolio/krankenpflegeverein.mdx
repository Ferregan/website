__kpv:__    As the creative hired for Krankenpflegevereine’s new headquarters in
    Klaus-Weiler-Fraxern, Vorarlberg, my task was to create a visual experience that
    went beyond ordinary architecture. I aimed to effectively communicate the
    institution’s values of holistic healthcare and support, while establishing a
    strong emotional bond between the residents and the breathtaking surrounding
    landscape.          The result is a truly captivating transformation. The
    building’s façade comes alive with an interactive image showcasing a dynamic
    panorama: people moving through the magnificent Austrian Alps, representing the
    region’s unique character. Accompanying them are the dedicated members of
    Krankenpflegevereine, symbolizing their unwavering commitment to the community.
    This intervention seamlessly turns the building into a vibrant meeting point for
    the region, where residents feel a profound sense of connection through custom
    illustrations.          Additionally, I designed and illustrated an interior
    signage system for offices, laboratories, and corridors that harmonizes with the
    exterior artwork.
