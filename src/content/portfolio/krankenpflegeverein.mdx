As the creative hired for Krankenpflegevereine’s new headquarters in
Klaus-Weiler-Fraxern, Vorarlberg, my task was to create a visual experience that
went beyond ordinary architecture. I aimed to effectively communicate the
institution’s values of holistic healthcare and support, while establishing a
strong emotional bond between the residents and the breathtaking surrounding
landscape.          The result is a truly captivating transformation. The
building’s façade comes alive with an interactive image showcasing a dynamic
panorama: people moving through the magnificent Austrian Alps, representing the
region’s unique character. Accompanying them are the dedicated members of
Krankenpflegevereine, symbolizing their unwavering commitment to the community.
This intervention seamlessly turns the building into a vibrant meeting point for
the region, where residents feel a profound sense of connection through custom
illustrations.          Additionally, I designed and illustrated an interior
signage system for offices, laboratories, and corridors that harmonizes with the
exterior artwork.
