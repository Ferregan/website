Kassa 24 is a cash register software designed to cater to the needs of small
businesses and self-employed individuals who, in their day-to-day operations,
strive to discover an optimized system for processing cash and card payments
seamlessly, while also maintaining a well-structured invoicing process. After
collaborating closely with the marketing team, my role involved creating an
illustrative scene for this brand. The objective was to depict, in a
lighthearted manner, how this software is so user-friendly that it becomes a
charming experience. Kassa 24 and its team would utilize this illustration to
integrate it into web applications, employing it as promotional material in
various business magazines to advertise this exceptional software.
