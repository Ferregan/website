I am Gustavo Ferregan, a graphic artist turned illustrator and art director. My work is on websites, editorial projects, advertising, and maybe even your favorite coffee mug. Want to chat? Drop me a line. Want to get serious? Let’s talk work: gustavo@ferregan.com. Or, if you’re near, stop by my studio for coffee—it has a great view of the Austrian Alps.
