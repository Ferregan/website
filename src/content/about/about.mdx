<Description>
I am Gustavo Ferregan, a Colombian artist in Austria. Used to work in museum offices and teach design. Then I moved to the Alps and shifted my career to illustration. Now my work can be found on websites, editorial, and advertising.
 
 I like stories about pointless struggles, the tragicomedy of modern life, and humans being weird together. I also run workshops and rally sketching enthusiasts in the mountains.
