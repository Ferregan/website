*Info*

<br />

I'm Gustavo Ferregan


I draw common people being hit by a kind of revelation


My work is about waiting, wondering, trying —and sometimes failing


People pretending. People slipping. People being people


It’s how I make sense of things



I’m an illustrator and art director, by the way


And I do this for editorial, advertising, branding — 

sometimes with teams, and other times just for myself
