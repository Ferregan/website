I’m gustavo ferregan, a graphic artist who got sucked into the world of commercial illustration and ended up as an illustrator and art director. my work can be found on websites, editorial projects, advertising, and maybe even your favorite coffee mug. want to chat? drop me a line. want to get serious? let’s talk work: gustavo@ferregan.com. or, if you're near, come by for coffee at my studio—it has a great view of the austrian alps.
