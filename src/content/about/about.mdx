Hello visitor, thank you for stopping by! I'm Gustavo Ferregan, a Colombian
illustrator and art director based in Austria. I founded Ferregan in 2022, an
independent studio in the Austrian Alps, specializing in illustration and
design. I work on visual experiences globally across various media, such as
branding, print, and digital platforms. I aim to simplify visual communication
for greater accessibility. Feel free to contact me for commissions,
collaborations, or a friendly chat. Gladly contact me in English, German, or
Spanish.
