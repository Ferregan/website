<Description>
    Gustavo Ferregan is a Colombo-Austrian illustrator. The stories people share with him about others and his twisted joke notebook frequently inspire his work. His drawings often feature common people who seem to be hit by a revelation.
He works from his studio in the alpine region of Vorarlberg with both local and international brands.
